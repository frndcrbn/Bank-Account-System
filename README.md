# Bank Account System

# A Bank can have multiple Customers, and a Customer can have multiple Accounts (e.g. savings, checking, credit).

# The Account class should have methods for deposits, withdrawals, and checking the balance.

# The Customer class should have methods for displaying the customer's name, address, and a list of their accounts.

# The Bank class should have methods for adding and removing customers, as well as displaying a list of all customers.
